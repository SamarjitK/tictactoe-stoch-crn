# Tic Tac Toe Stochastic CRN

This project currently contains notebook(s) accessible under ```simulation/``` that utilize [ppsim](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/ppsim) to build stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRN) that can simulate gameplay.

To install dependencies for ppsim, run:

```pip install -r ./ppsim/requirements.txt```

To install the ppsim package:

```pip install ./ppsim```

To run simulation code (in progress) run:

```python3 simulation-code/*.py```
