The core of the simulator uses a [batching algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03584) which gives significant asymptotic gains for protocols with relatively small reachable state sets. The package is designed to be run in a Python notebook, to concisely describe complex protocols, efficiently simulate their dynamics, and provide helpful visualization of the simulation.\n",
